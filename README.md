## Introduction

This project aims to develop an SVM (Support Vector Machine) based approach for the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease management. Machine learning techniques, like SVM, have shown promising results in diagnosing medical conditions, and this project explores their application to Parkinson's Disease diagnosis.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use the scikit-learn library to build an SVM model for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains relevant features extracted from patients' clinical assessments. The code is written in Python, and the primary libraries used are scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information collected from patients with Parkinson's Disease. It consists of various clinical features such as motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, age, sex, and others. The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure its suitability for training the SVM model.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```
